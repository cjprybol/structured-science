## Guidelines

Keep ideas to a single page.

Express one idea, one line at a time.

## Interaction guidelines

Everything should be written using a version control system.

GitHub makes this easy with code-spaces - your computing environment is tied to your repository.

Every analysis should have the environment defined with a container.

By default, only you can see everything that you make.

Make a practice with sharing with as many people as possible.

YYYY-MM-DD-INITIALS-task-description.ipynb as the naming convention.

Use the git limit for repo storage as your barometer for whether to cache the data with the repo or whether to rely on external storage locations.

Maximum file size is 100 MB
Maximum repository size is 10 GB (10K MB)
