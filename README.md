## Guidelines

Keep ideas to a single page.

Express one idea, one line at a time.

## Interaction guidelines

Record your ideas in Git or another version control system.

Develop in GitHub codespaces, or another environment that ties defined pieces of code to defined computing environments (docker container)

By default, everything is private.

Given everything defaults to private, make a practice with sharing with as many people as possible.

YYYY-MM-DD-INITIALS-task-description.ipynb as the naming convention.

The account tied to the github commit/repository provides a confirmatory datapoint of who the author is.

Use the git limit for repo storage as your barometer for whether to cache the data with the repo or whether to rely on external storage locations.

Maximum file size is 100 MB
